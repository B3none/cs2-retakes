2. Copy `cfg/cs2-retakes/retakes.cfg` to `/game/csgo/cfg/cs2-retakes/retakes.cfg`

## Recommendations
I also recommend installing these plugins for an improved player experience
- Instadefuse: https://github.com/B3none/cs2-instadefuse
- Instaplant: https://github.com/B3none/cs2-instaplant
- Clutch Announce: https://github.com/B3none/cs2-clutch-announce

This package comes with a weapon allocation system, however I recommend using **one** of the following plugins for a better experience
- Ravid's Allocator: https://github.com/Ravid-A/cs2-retakes-weapon-allocator
- Yoni's Allocator: https://github.com/yonilerner/cs2-retakes-allocator
