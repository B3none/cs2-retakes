## Installation
- Download the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/B3none/cs2-retakes/releases), and extract the contents into your `counterstrikesharp/plugins` directory.
- Download the [shared plugin zip file](https://github.com/B3none/cs2-retakes/releases/download/2.0.0/cs2-retakes-plugin-shared-2.0.0.zip) and put it into your `counterstrikesharp/shared` directory.

## Recommendations
I also recommend installing these plugins for an improved player experience
- Instadefuse: https://github.com/B3none/cs2-instadefuse
- Clutch Announce: https://github.com/B3none/cs2-clutch-announce
- Instaplant (if not using autoplant): https://github.com/B3none/cs2-instaplant

## Allocators
Although this plugin comes with it's own weapon allocation system, I would recommend using **one** of the following plugins for a better experience:
- Yoni's Allocator: https://github.com/yonilerner/cs2-retakes-allocator
- NokkviReyr's Allocator: https://github.com/nokkvireyr/kps-allocator
- Ravid's Allocator: https://github.com/Ravid-A/cs2-retakes-weapon-allocator

## Configuration
When the plugin is first loaded it will create a `retakes_config.json` file in the plugin directory. This file contains all of the configuration options for the plugin:
